          <AnswerSection
            content={`Given that Pakistan is an extremely conservative Muslim nation, you should take extra care with your attire. 
            In public, all sexes are recommended to keep their shoulders, arms, and legs covered. T-shirts and jeans or trousers are appropriate for men practically anywhere. The traditional dress and pant set known as a shalwar kameez is best and most comfortable for both men and women. 
            Shirts for women often have sleeves that are at least 3/4 length and cover your butt. The best clothing to wear is looser clothing that conceals your body's shape; keep cleavage- and curve-revealing attire at home. Long pants are essential, but as long as your butt is covered by your shirt, tighter apparel, such as narrow jeans and leggings, won't draw too much attention. 
            In the mountains, you can dress a little more freely because locals are accustomed to seeing tourists trekking in a variety of outfits. Even though we still advise wearing long sleeves, if you plan to walk all day you can get away with wearing a t-shirt. Please don't wear shorts again. 
            Outside of mosques, it is not compulsory to cover your head, however women should always carry a scarf. If you feel uneasy, you can wear it to conceal your chest in more conservative settings like bazaars or your head in religious settings.`}
